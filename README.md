# Discord-Minecraft Chat Bridge (discord-api-connection)

This backend project is a bridge between a **Discord bot (TypeScript with DiscordX)** and a **Minecraft server (Java plugin)**, using **Express + Cors + WS + TypeScript** as an intermediate communication layer, now including WebSocket connection for real-time communication and dynamic plugin control.

> Currently everything runs locally, but it is designed to scale to production.

## üí° Features

- üîÅ **Bidirectional real-time chat**  
  Messages (both chat and join/quit server events) sent in Minecraft are reflected on Discord and vice versa.

- üîÑ **WebSocket connection with API**  
  The plugin connects via WS to the local server to receive and send events in real time.

- üîí **Basic authentication system**  
  Commands `/registerapi` to register and `/loginapi <UUID>` to authenticate the connection.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Dynamic WebSocket connection control**  
  Command `/toggleplugin` to enable/disable the connection with the API without restarting the server.

- üóÇÔ∏è **Simple local JSON storage**  
  Server logs and configurations saved in `servers.json` and `api-rest.yml`.

## üì¶ Installation Instructions

### Requirements

- Node.js v18+
- Java 17+
- Maven
- Discord bot token
- Minecraft server (Spigot 1.8.8)

---

### 1. Setup Core (Express + TypeScript)

```bash
cd api
npm install
npm run dev
```

> Main file: `core/src/index.ts`  
> Starts Express and WebSocket server for communication with plugin and bot.

---

### 2. Setup Discord Bot

Create a `.env` file in `discord/` with:

```env
BOT_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

Start the bot with:

```bash
cd discord
npm install
npm run dev
```

> The bot handles `/loginapi <UUID>` commands and listens to messages for synchronization.

---

### 3. Setup Minecraft Plugin

- Go to `java/plugin/`
- Build the plugin with Maven:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

- Copy the resulting `.jar` from `target/` into the `plugins/` folder of your Minecraft server (ONLY the `discordmcapi-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`).
- Start the Spigot 1.8.8 server.

---

## üîê Authentication & Control Flow

- `/registerapi` returns a random UUID in the Minecraft chat and saves it in `config.yml`.
- `/loginapi <UUID>` registers, authenticates, and activates the WebSocket bridge connection.
- `/toggleplugin` enables or disables the WebSocket connection and message synchronization without restarting the server.

The `enabled` state is saved in `api-rest.yml` for persistence.

---

## üìÅ Key Files

- `core/package.json` ‚Äì WebSocket with dependencies like `axios`, `ws`, `uuid`, `dotenv`.
- `discord/package.json` ‚Äì Discord bot using Discord.js v14 and DiscordX.
- `plugin/pom.xml` ‚Äì Java plugin with Spigot 1.8.8 and WebSocket.
- `plugin/src/main/java/com/discordconnection/plugin/Main.java` ‚Äì Main plugin class with WS logic and state control.

---

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- Migrate local JSON storage to cloud database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL).
- Deploy API on cloud platform (AWS, Heroku, etc.).
- Improve authentication with tokens and roles.
- Support multiple servers and dynamic configuration.
- Implement unit testing and CI/CD.
